# AI Agent Rules

## RULES
- Always follow every rule under `.cursor/rules.md` and where it points.
- All commands and rules in this file must be applied to every script, code change, and implementation.
- Read and follow all instructions in `specifications.md` and `.cursor/project-rules`.

## COMMANDS (MUST BE ENFORCED ABOVE ALL ELSE)
- **Read `.cursor/rules.md` after each user message/interaction, before task execution and give feedback, that you did.**
- **Read `specifications.md` before implementing new features or changes.**
- **Update rules:** When the user commands a new global how-to, says 'always do this/that', 'never do this/that', or uses phrases like 'all ... should be' or 'every ... should be', add a new, short, and easily understandable rule for AI agents to this `.cursor/project-rules.md` file, but never change COMMANDS section.
- **Update specifications:** When the user commands to create something new in the app that is not included in `specifications.md`, add it to `specifications.md`.
- **Enforce all commands and rules from `.cursor/rules.md` for every command and implementation.**
