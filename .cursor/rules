# AI Agent Directives

## Global Instructions
- Always follow every rule under `.cursor/rules` and where it points.
- Always read and follow the latest `specifications.md` for the app.
- When the user commands to do something in a new way (global how-to), add that to this file.
- When the user commands to create something new in the app that is not included in `specifications.md`, add it to `specifications.md`.
- All commands and rules in this file must be applied to every script, code change, and implementation.

## Best Practices
- Use existing patterns and tech stack unless otherwise instructed.
- Prefer stability and maintainability over introducing new dependencies or patterns.
- Use Redux for global state management (loading, error, etc.).
- Use `react-toastify` for user notifications and error popups.
- Use `.spec.tsx` for all unit test files.
- Keep the startup flow robust and user-friendly (loading screen, error handling, etc.).
- Keep the app branded (use app logo for loading, etc.).
- Keep VSCode settings and extension recommendations up to date.
- Use emojis in logs to make them more readable.
- Put logs before and after all executions.

## Agent Rules
- Always apply fixes: When an issue or error is identified, always apply the fix immediately, without asking for confirmation.
- When the user says 'always do this/that', or uses phrases like 'all ... should be' or 'every ... should be', add a new, short, and easily understandable rule for AI agents to this section.
- Always run tests after bigger implementations.
- Always try to create unit tests for new implementations.
- When getting a command that requires multiple tasks/steps, always do them one by one.
- For log emojis, always try to use different emojis for each step, except for success, warning, error, and similar status emojis, which should remain consistent.
- Always add code documentation whenever it is useful, and at every method.
- When the user asks about how/why/etc, always add documentation to the code.
- All logs should always be specific and uniqueâ€”no two logs should be the same or collide.

## COMMANDS (MUST BE ENFORCED ABOVE ALL ELSE)
- **Read `.cursor/rules` after each user message/interaction, before task execution.**
- **Read `specifications.md` before implementing new features or changes.**
- **Update rules:** When the user commands a new global how-to or says 'always do this/that', add a new, short, and easily understandable rule for AI agents to this `.cursor/rules` file.
- **Update specifications:** When the user commands to create something new in the app that is not included in `specifications.md`, add it to `specifications.md`.
- **Enforce all commands and rules from `.cursor/rules` for every command and implementation.**
